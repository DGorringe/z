    documentation="Anglian Water will seek to promote the business value of good quality data, and the business contribution of data management. Data assets are truly assets because they have business value, tangible or intangible.&#xA;&#xA;Anglian Water will also seek to provide a universal understanding of the vocabulary of data management.&#xA;&#xA;Anglian Water will promote the principle that the virtual asset is just as important as the physical asset, and that the consequences of a data quality issue may be just as significant as a physical issue.&#xA;&#xA;Promoting the value of good quality data and rigorous data management helps to drive the right behaviours."/>
