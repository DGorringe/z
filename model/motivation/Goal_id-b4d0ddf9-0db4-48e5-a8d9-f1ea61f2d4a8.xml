    documentation="Business intelligence funding and governance practices are re-evaluated so that the import, modelling, and provision of new areas of data deemed to be of strategic value to the business as a whole are not unduly constrained by individual project remits, and that these constraints do not act as a deterrent to the channelling, procurement, and management of data via this route. Business intelligence becomes the forward-looking, enterprise-level provider of a self-service capability, rather than the reactive provider of localised point solutions. It is driven by an over-arching data strategy in line with the overall business strategy."/>
