    documentation="Enterprise data management is a continuous, incremental improvement process, rather than a distinct programme with a start and end. The challenges of data integration and data quality cannot be solved in one go. &#xA;&#xA;Current challenges will be addressed per subject area, not per system or business-unit. There will be a planned, phased approach, with the most cost effective subject areas given the highest priority after due consideration of cost v benefit v risk.&#xA;&#xA;Anglian Water will undertake data management activity in small, incremental steps. Each task will be specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and timely (SMART). &#xA;&#xA;Although data management platforms and processes will encompass small areas of data at a time, they will be designed and built with the long-term in mind, such that they can grow as each new subject area is&#xA;brought in line.&#xA;&#xA;In order to be successful, it is vital not to attempt to“boil the ocean”. Data management requires long term objectives, but short term goals.">
