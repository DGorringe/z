    documentation="We will understand the risk of failure for all of our underground and overground assets, enabling us to measure the probability and impact on customer service failure, and develop more accurate business plans as we consider future investment. We will mitigate the risk of incorrectly calculating the pot of money we need to support our asset base, or the time needed to refresh that asset base, or from choosing the wrong replacement asset.&#xA;&#xA;We will leverage high quality inter-connected data to automate ODI reporting, and provide operational managers with insight from lead measures, thereby giving us the best opportunity to outperform our targets and reduce the risk of penalties.&#xA;&#xA;We will respond to an ever-changing and increasingly regulatory environment, thereby maintaining our strong track record of performance and compliance that gives us credibility and influence on matters important to us.&#xA;&#xA;We will develop our approaches to self-reporting and assurance processes in a regime where we expect our customers to hold us to account, and where regulators demand greater levels of transparency and evidence of our actions."/>
